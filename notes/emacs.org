   - M-x imenu will let you jump to a function
   definition (etc.) by name. You can also bind it to a mouse click to
   get a menu of functions (or add it to the menubar; see the Info page
   for more detail). It provides data for which-function-mode, which will
   let you see which function you are currently inside in the
   modeline. 
   - Speedbar displays the imenu information (and
   other things) graphically.
